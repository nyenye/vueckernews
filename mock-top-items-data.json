Command line tools written in Perl, Python, Node, JavaScript are <i>always</i> more effort to get going, and <i>much</i> more effort if you’re (a) using Windows, or (b) unwilling to pollute &#x2F;usr or equivalent with things that won’t be managed by the OS’s package manager.</p><p>Every non-standard tool that you get in the habit of using is another piece of friction when switching machines or using a machine not configured as your own, where you may not even be able to install things. With Rust, I know I’ll be able to get it going easily, regardless of whether it’s in some OS-level package manager: it’ll be a single binary that I can just drop into my personal bin directory, and it’ll just <i>work</i>.</p><p>Seriously, the deployment story is just <i>so good</i> for languages that compile into a single statically-linked binary, when compared with dynamic languages.</p><p>So my threshold for “will I bother trying this non-standard tool out?” tends to be much lower for something written in Rust. I have several Rust utilities that I take the trouble of installing, and now only one non-Rust utility that I use in this fashion, git-revise (Python, and git-rebase is generally a tolerable alternative if I can’t set git-revise up).</p><p>Well then, back to my narrative. I wasn’t actually expecting it to be in Rust (though on reflection, why not?), but when I saw “cargo install broot”, I cackled aloud.</p><p>And I’ve just run `cargo install broot`.</p>",

        "text": "<p>Looks like <i>really</i> cool and useful project. Is it usable on Windows though? \nI can&#x27;t press Shift key to enter &quot;:&quot; for commands. Seems like a dealbreaker. I tested it on WSL and Ubuntu on VM and Shift works there.</p><p>Anyway. This look <i>super</i> cool. I&#x27;m a Windows guy but have been using terminal more lately with tools like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;ripgrep\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;ripgrep</a> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sharkdp&#x2F;bat\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sharkdp&#x2F;bat</a> <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sharkdp&#x2F;fd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sharkdp&#x2F;fd</a> and they work great on Windows (plus are easily installable by <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scoop.sh&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scoop.sh&#x2F;</a>). Hope the Windows story will improve for Broot to.</p><p>Some suggestions after <i>very</i> quick look (except not working Shift key on Windows).</p><p>* Screen refreshing and general experience is really slow. Hold arrow key for couple of seconds and see that refreshing can&#x27;t catch up. The best performance is on standard windows cmd, a bit worse on new &quot;Windows Terminal (Preview)&quot;, absolutely horrible on ConEmu (which I use daily :-( )</p><p>* I sort of expected that I can &quot;scroll&quot; current directory but I get &quot;400 unlisted&quot; text at the bottom. It makes sense for nested directories and looks like main feature of Broot. But for _current directory_ it would be great if it didn&#x27;t &quot;trim&quot; entries at the end and you could just use standard arrows keys, PageUp&#x2F;PageDown and Home&#x2F;End to quickly glance and see what files are available when I don&#x27;t know what file names I&#x27;m looking for. And when I would want to do the same for some nested directory I would just select it with Enter.\nSo basically it would be great if Broot was more like <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;junegunn&#x2F;fzf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;junegunn&#x2F;fzf</a> but not just for flat list of files.</p>",

Both were for DOS so it seems to be an original innovation from the DOS world.

It had one of the fastest floppy formatters around, and just about the fastest DOS disk-defragmenter I ever saw, nearly an order of magnitude quicker than Norton&#x27;s.</p><p>The PC Tools backup&#x2F;restore tool was also superb and extremely fast. It used an extended disk format, squeezing about 1.6 MB onto an HD 3½&quot; floppy, and compressed data on the fly, so many megabytes of software or data could be squeezed onto the minimum number of floppies.</p><p>Benchmarks: <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oldskool.org&#x2F;guides&#x2F;dosbackupshootout\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oldskool.org&#x2F;guides&#x2F;dosbackupshootout</a></p><p>Unlike rival extended formats, if you tried to DIR the disk from DOS, you got a warning message:\n<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.os2museum.com&#x2F;wp&#x2F;the-central-point-backup-floppy-format&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.os2museum.com&#x2F;wp&#x2F;the-central-point-backup-floppy-...</a></p><p>What doomed Central Point software is that it did a licensing deal with Microsoft. Cut-down versions of PC Tools Backup and the separate Central Point Antivirus were bundled with MS-DOS 6. Microsoft promised CP that CP would make money from DOS 6 customers wishing to upgrade to the full versions.</p><p>In actual fact, people got by with the freebie versions and CP&#x27;s sales of standalone products _and_ upgrades both stagnated.</p><p>MS tried similar tactics on STAC in the hope of bundling the Stacker disk-compression tool with MS-DOS 6. STAC, wisely, said no.</p><p>So Microsoft just stole the code and used it anyway.</p><p>STAC sued, won, and got $120M damages.</p><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;la-xpm-1994-02-24-fi-26671-story.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;la-xpm-1994-02-24-fi-26671-...</a></p><p>It used the money wisely,  to diversify the company out of disk compression by acquisition, buying vendors of remote-control software (ReachOut) and enterprise backup (Replica).</p><p>Sadly, this was long before ubiquitous Internet connectivity, even by dial-up modem. ReachOut mainly worked by direct-dial modem-to-modem comms -- useful, but expensive, as each machine to be controlled needs a modem, a telephone line and its own phone number.</p><p>It wasn&#x27;t enough and STAC ended up going broke. Central Point Software was bought out by Symantec, like Quarterdeck and Norton and others.</p><p>MS-DOS 6 was badly buggy anyway and MS had to release a free update, MS-DOS 6.2. (Note, at this time, product updates, service packs, etc. were <i>extremely</i> rare.)</p><p>Then, when it lost the STAC lawsuit, it released another update, MS-DOS 6.21, which simply removed disk compression altogether.</p><p>Then MS rewrote the offending code and released MS-DOS 6.22, <i>another</i> free update, replacing the infringing &quot;DoubleSpace&quot; with &quot;DriveSpace&quot; -- basically the same tool but with different compression&#x2F;decompression routines.</p><p>This was the last-ever version of MS-DOS, and thus DOS 6 has the dubious distinction of being the most-patched release in history.</p><p>There are details of this on Wikipedia but it&#x27;s been sanitised by MS PR so it merely mentions patent infringement, rather than the direct code theft involved.</p><p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tedium.co&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;04&#x2F;disk-compression-stacker-doublespace-history&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tedium.co&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;04&#x2F;disk-compression-stacker-double...</a></p>",

Broot is one way of looking at a volume at the expense of lots of disk reads (for every file on the volume). Ranger does that at a single depth and that&#x27;s a design choice in Miller&#x27;s view. nnn doesn&#x27;t prefer to read within directories unless explicitly requested and that&#x27;s a design choice too. There&#x27;s nothing good or bad about these other than a choice to the user to pick the one that fits his use case.</p><p>A user always has the liberty to concentrate only on the current directory, just know where he is in the filesystem from the file path and do a fuzzy search to find a file deep in the subtree when he needs to do so. As you might have noticed, even with Broot there&#x27;s no simple way to list the files marked &quot;unlisted&quot; without navigating to the dir and expanding it. It&#x27;s a nice program and is a solution to people who likes to see a snapshot of the filesystem in a glance. But would everyone be always interested in the contents of &#x2F;etc, &#x2F;run, &#x2F;usr and &#x2F;var as shown in one of the sample images?</p>",
